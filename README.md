## Summary
The Daily Planner is a ToDo SPA that's different than other ToDo apps in that it's oriented aroun 'BrainJuice'. BrainJuice is the mental/psychological effort that a task requires of you. By grouping tasks by BrainJuice, you are more effective and waste less time/energy transitioning in/out of tasks.
